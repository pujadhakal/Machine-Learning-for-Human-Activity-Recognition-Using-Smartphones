# Machine-Learning-for-Human-Activity-Recognition-Using-Smartphones
Understanding and classifying human movements is critical in many disciplines, including  healthcare and sports analytics. With the introduction of wearable technology, such as cellphones  equipped with accelerometers and gyroscopes, the capacity to record and analyze human  movement patterns has become more accessible and insightful.

The dataset under examination is the result of thorough tests performed on a cohort of 30 volunteers ranging in age from 19 to 48 years. Each participant was tasked with doing six separate tasks while wearing a Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone around their waist. These exercises included daily movements such as walking, upstairs, downstairs, sitting, standing, and laying. Using the smartphone's inbuilt accelerometer and gyroscope, the studies recorded 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant sampling rate of 50 Hz. To ensure data integrity and correctness, the experiments were videotaped, allowing for rigorous hand labeling of the collected data. The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% 
overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low-frequency components; therefore, a filter with a 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domains.

My main task is to use K-Means and DBSCAN to cluster on the given dataset and use a dimensionality reduction technique for K-Means and DBSCAN on the dataset. And analyze the result I get from 4 different models.
